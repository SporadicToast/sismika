<h1> sismika - the modern earthquake event visualizer </h1>
<p> sismika (seismic) is a pure Javascript web applet that integrates locations of <a href='https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/vault/html/Seismicity%20Maps/2020/Philippines-Seismic-Network-2020-(December)_.jpg'>DOST seismic stations</a> and the <a href='https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/'>USGS public API</a> specifically for seismic events inside the Philippine Area of Responsibility </p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Displays most recent seismic events noted by the USGS</li>
	<li>Shows relative positions of Philippine Seismic Network Stations on the map</li>
	<li>(TBA) An EWS calculator that estimates how many seconds (from detection of P-wave and the propagation of S-wave) your location has to prepare before a seismic event is detected and arrives</li>
	</ol>

<h2> Afterword </h2>
	This was written as a personal project during my First Year in the University of the Philippines Diliman and is heavily inspired by applications such as <a href='https://jquake.net'>JQuake</a> (which I didn't know existed when I made this applet) and <a href='https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/en/Activities/eew.html'>JMA's Earthquake Early Warning System</a>.<br> 
	I am looking for like-minded programmers and those allied to the geology field to contact me at mcmacaraeg2(at)up.edu.ph as I plan to make a much more comprehensive version of this program as a hobby. <br>
	I am also currently advocating that the Philippine Seismic Network be made available publicly to allow hobbyists to use the data for constructive projects such as these. You may also contact me at the same email if you are aware of any method to get earthquake information short of web-scraping the DOST PHIVOLCS website every n seconds.
